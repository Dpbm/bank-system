# First DIO's Python project

This is the first challenge in python for the `NTT DATA - Engenharia de Dados com Python` DIO's bootcamp.

The challenge itself consists in creating a `bank sytstem` in python. In it, we needed to implement three main operations: `deposit`, `withdrawal` and `bank statement`.

## How to run

To run this project, you may need `Python3`, an then run in your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
```
```
